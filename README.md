# MATLAB Artificial Neural Networking Project

This is a project that involved developing a feed-forward backpropagation ANN for predicting the crystal growth rates of multiple organic compounds and comparing it to the a MNLR.

Although this was completed on MATLAB, this can be easily executed using Python (as the bulk work is completed).
